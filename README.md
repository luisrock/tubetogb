# YouTube to GarageBand
> Extract Audio from YouTube Video and Open it as (stereo) Track on GarageBand With Python

## Requirements

You have to have youtube_dl installed on your system

``` pip install youtube_dl ```

You have to have GarageBand installed on your Mac (of course...)

## Installation and usage

1. Create a Python 3 virtual environment on a folder
